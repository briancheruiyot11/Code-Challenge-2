# Event Guest List Manager

## Description
This project is a simple **Event Guest List Manager** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage an event's guest list dynamically without requiring a page refresh. Users can easily add, remove, and update guest entries. This is a deliverable-driven challenge focused on DOM manipulation and user interaction through forms.

## Project Setup

Your project files should be structured as follows:

- `index.html` — Contains the HTML layout and structure.  
- `style.css` — Responsible for styling the layout and making it visually appealing.  
- `src/index.js` — Contains JavaScript logic for handling user interaction and DOM updates.

## Deliverables

As a user, you should be able to:

- Type a guest's name into the input field.
- Click the submit button to add the guest to the list.
- See the guest's name appear immediately on the page once added.
- Remove a guest from the list by clicking the "Remove" button next to their name.
- See a "Remove" button next to each guest in the list.
- Add guests only up to a maximum of 10. You'll be alerted if you exceed the limit.
- Toggle each guest’s RSVP status between **“Attending”** and **“Not Attending”**.


## How to Use  

Follow these simple steps to use the guest list manager:

1. **Enter a Guest's Name**
   - Start by typing the guest’s name into the input field provided.

2. **Select a Guest Category**
   - Before adding a guest, choose whether they are a **Friend**, **Family**, or **Colleague** using the dropdown menu or category selector.
   - Each category is visually marked with a different color tag in the guest list.

3. **Add the Guest**
   - Click the **Submit** button to add the name to the guest list.
   - The name will instantly appear in a list below the form.

4. **Remove a Guest**
   - Next to each guest, you’ll see a **Remove** button.
   - Click it to delete that guest from the list.

5. **RSVP Status**
   - Each guest can be marked as either **Attending** or **Not Attending**.
   - Use the **Toggle RSVP** button next to each name to switch their status.

6. **Guest Limit**
   - The list supports up to **10 guests**.
   - If you try to add more, you’ll receive an alert telling you the limit has been reached.
